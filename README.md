* [VMProtect](http://vmpsoft.com/)
* [Code Virtualizer](http://oreans.com/)
* [O-LLVM](https://github.com/obfuscator-llvm/obfuscator)

The code is in active development and difficult to use. Currently there is no documentation (please contact me if you are interested in). I try also to prepare a paper (there are lots of thing to be done).
